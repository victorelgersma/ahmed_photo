                    Hi, I’m Ahmed. I was born in Gaza 1994. I live as a
                    Brussels-based photographer with a focus on portraits,
                    events, and documentary stories. I love capturing real,
                    unscripted moments and creating images that feel honest and
                    alive.
                </p>

                    If you're organising an event or want to preserve a
                    meaningful moment in your life, I’m here to craft images
                    that are genuine, expressive, and true to who you are.
