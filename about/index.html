                Hi, I’m Ahmed. I was born in Gaza 1994. I live as a
                Brussels-based photographer with a focus on portraits, events,
                and documentary stories. I love capturing real, unscripted
                moments and creating images that feel honest and alive.
            </p>

            <br />
            <p class="tagline">
                If you're organising an event or want to preserve a meaningful
                moment in your life, I’m here to craft images that are genuine,
                expressive, and true to who you are.
            </p>
